# 🎯 **YOUR REAL GOAL - What's Actually In Your Mind**

Based on your document, here's what you **REALLY** want to build:

---

## **🧠 THE BIG VISION**

### **Project: "Kage no Koe" (影の声 - Shadow Voice) / "LocalMind"**

**Your True Goal:**
> **Build a completely private, self-hosted AI assistant that lives entirely on YOUR computer—no cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your machine—but with the intelligence and capabilities of ChatGPT PLUS advanced features for working with YOUR documents and YOUR files.**

---

## **💡 WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO CREATE**

### **The Core Idea:**
You want your **own personal AI brain** that:

1. **Lives on your hardware** (laptop or desktop)
2. **Understands your documents** (PDFs, Word, Excel, images)
3. **Searches your computer files** when you ask questions
4. **Searches the web** when it needs current info
5. **Remembers context** across conversations
6. **Streams responses** like ChatGPT (word-by-word)
7. **Works offline** (except for web search)
8. **Costs nothing to run** after setup
9. **Protects your privacy** (everything local)
10. **Scales from weak laptop to powerful desktop**

## **🎨 THE WORKING SYSTEM YOU ENVISION**

### **What It Looks Like:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR BRAIN  →  "Kage no Koe" AI  →    │
│                                          │
│  "Summarize this PDF I uploaded"        │
│  "Find files about IoT on my PC"        │
│  "What's the latest news on AI?"        │
│  "Remember this context for all chats"  │
│                                          │
│  [Upload files] [Switch AI models]      │
│  [GPU Monitor] [Dark Mode]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **What It Does:**
✅ **Chat**: Like ChatGPT, but yours  
✅ **Document Intelligence**: Upload PDF → AI reads it → You ask questions  
✅ **Image Understanding**: Upload image → OCR + Vision → AI describes it  
✅ **File Search**: "Find my tax documents" → Searches your PC  
✅ **Web Search**: "Who won the 2024 election?" → Searches web → Uses results  
✅ **Context Memory**: Remembers what you told it globally or per-chat  
✅ **Model Switching**: Use small model on laptop, big model on desktop  
✅ **Export Chats**: Save conversations as PDF, TXT, JSON

- Database: SQLite for chat history + file metadata
- File Processing: PDF/DOCX/XLSX parsers + OCR + Vision models
- Search: Local file indexing + web search integration
- Context: Smart memory management across conversations
- Performance: CPU fallback, GPU optimization

**Estimated Build Time:** 40-80 hours depending on experience

## **🚀 THE MINIMAL WORKING VERSION (What You Actually Need First)**

Forget the 8 phases. Here's what you **actually** need first:

### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
```
Week 1-2: Basic Chat (20 hours)
├─ Install Ollama + small model
├─ Flask backend with streaming
├─ Simple web UI
└─ Can send message, get AI response

Week 3: Add ONE Feature (10 hours)
└─ Either: PDF upload OR local file search OR web search
   (Pick the one you need most)

Week 4: Polish (10 hours)
└─ Make it actually usable daily
```

**Total: 40 hours = 4 weeks (10 hrs/week)**

After this, you'll have something **WORKING** that you can **USE DAILY**.

Then add features as you need them.

- Start small, scale later

**Kage no Koe Project Goal:**
- Build personal AI assistant
- Learn AI + full-stack integration
- Start simple, add features later

### **Both Share:**
- **Software-first approach** (you're strongest here)
- **Local-first architecture** (no cloud dependence)
- **Scalable foundation** (start small, grow big)
- **Long-term vision** (use for years)

## **💭 MY READ On What's In Your Mind**

You're not just building tools. You're building **your digital infrastructure**:

1. **IoT Project** = Control your physical space  
2. **Kage no Koe** = Augment your mental space

You want tools that:
- **You own** (not rented from BigTech)
- **You control** (open source, local)
- **You understand** (built by you)
- **You extend** (add features forever)

This is the **maker/hacker mindset** applied to both hardware and AI.
